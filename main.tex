\section*{Projects}

As many of my projects are software based, you can find a lot of them on my
github which can be found \href{https://github.com/matt1795}{here}.

Some of the most interesting from github include:

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item BCIT-Sailbot: A multidisciplinary project to design and build an
    autonomous sailing robot.

    \item graphics: A C/C++ Image processing library

    \item elex-7660: Course project where I designed a composite video encoder
    using an FPGA in Verilog.

\end{itemize}

In addition to the above I've also worked extensively on a home setup of a CNC
router.

\section*{Education}

I am currently finishing my Bachelor's degree of Electrical and Computer
Engineering at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. I expect to
graduate May of 2018 and my capstone project is a wireless scoliosis brace
monitor.
